# New-York Taxi üöñ Dataset

## Description

This is a project from the Data Analyst course from [Karpov.Courses](https://external.ink?to=/https://karpov.courses/analytics) that I enrolled in June 2022. In the project, I used basic EDA techniques, from the pandas library, such as **.shape(), .dtypes, .describe, .groupby(), .idxmin(), .idxmax(), .sort\_values(), .pd.read\_csv()**, as well as writing functions.
