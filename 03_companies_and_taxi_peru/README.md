# 📌Companies, Taxi Peru // mini-project

## Description

This is another project from the Data Analyst course from [Karpov.Courses](https://external.ink?to=/https://karpov.courses/analytics) that I enrolled in June 2022. In this project, I used basic EDA and cleaning techniques, 
from the **Pandas** and **Seaborn** library, such as:

`pd.to_datetime`, 
`.dtypes`, 
`.groupby()`, `.agg()`
`.mul()`
`.reset_index()`
`.idxmax()`, 
`.sort_values()`, 
`.pd.read\_csv()` with `parse_dates` parametr
`.sns.set_palette()`, `sns.barplot()`, `sns.countplot()`
and finally calculate **MAU**
